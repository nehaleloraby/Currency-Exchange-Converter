Technologies used:
HTML

JavaScript (Vanilla)

Approach Taken: 
1. A user interface was designed using HTML and CSS. This design includes a space for users to input an amount value, two drop-down menus to account for the initial and final desired currencies, and a 'Get Exchange Rate' convert button. A space was also alloted to display the final result.   
2. To allow HTML elements to be interactive and responsive, DOM methods such as 'document.getElementByID' and 'document.querySelector' were used. Events such as '.addEventListener' were also added to allow for 'clicks' for specific events. 
3. Using the 'fetch' function, an external API was used (linked above) to obtain real-time currency data. Conversion logic was sorted to ensure that input amounts and currencies selected displayed accurate result. 
4. Animation was applied via HTML and CSS.
